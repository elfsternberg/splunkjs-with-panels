### This Code Is...

This repo is the sample code from the tutorial
[Referencing SimpleXML Searches From SplunkJS In Remote Panels](http://www.elfsternberg.com/2015/09/06/splunkjs-simplexml-panels/).
You can either read that tutorial or find the notes in this directory in
PDF form.

### Setup

Move or unzip this directory, in its entirely, to your Splunk
instance's apps directory.  Restart Splunk.  It should just work.

### Requirements

This was tested with Splunk 6.2.  It's not likely to work with earlier
versions that don't support &lt;panel&nbsp;ref="panelname"&gt; syntax.
